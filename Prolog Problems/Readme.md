## Prolog Stater Questions

<p>
Hello Guys!! These are some starter codes on prolog language. 
</p>
<p>
Doing these will give a general idea on how to approach prolog coding problems.

## Questions

<ol>
<li>To determine whether an element is a member of a set.</li>
<li>To determine whether a set is a subset of another set.</li>
<li>To determine intersection of two sets.</li>
<li>To determine union of two sets.</li>
<li>To determine difference of two sets.</li>
<li>To determine symmetric difference of two sets.</li>
<li>To delete nth element in L, leaving the rest in L1.</li>
<li>To replace nth element by another element X in L, leaving the resultant list in L1.</li>
<li>Interleave alternate elements of L1 and L2 into L. For example, if L1= [a, b, c] and L2= [1, 2], then L= [a, 1, b, 2, c].</li>
<li>Transpose L1, L2 into L. That is, if L1= [a, b, c] and L2= [1, 2, 3], then L= [(a, 1), (b, 2), (c, 3)].</li>
<li>Remove_every_other (L, L1) that is true if list L1 is just list L with every other element removed (the two lists should have the same first element).</li>
<li>Cutlast (L, L1) that defines L1 to be obtained from L with last element removed.</li>
<li>Trim (N, L, L1) that defines L1 to be obtained from L with first N elements removed.</li>
<li>Trimlast (N, L, L1) that defines L1 to be obtained from L with last N elements removed.</li>
<li>Exchange_first_last(L, L1), defines that L1 to be obtained from L with first and last elements exchanged. That is, ?-exchange_first_last([a, b, c, d, e], X). X= [e, b, c, d, a]</li>
<li>Circular_left_shift(L, L1). That is, if L= [a, b, c, d, e, f] then L1= [b, c, d, e, f, a]</li>
<li>Circular_right_shift(L, L1). That is, if L= [a, b, c, d, e, f] then L1= [f, a, b, c, d, e] [Try using circular_left_shift(L, L1) in 23 to implement circular_right_shift(L, L1).]</li>
<li>To delete the middle element from an odd-numbered list L into a list L1.</li>
<li>To delete two middle elements from an even-numbered list L into a list L1.</li>
<li>To implement unfold (L, L1) that reverses the elements of (an odd numbered) list L, from 1 to middle-1 elements and middle+1 to last element and store the result in L1.</li>
</ol>
